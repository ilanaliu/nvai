Adam Jones' department store held an 
annual sale Tuesday through the end of the week.
Sporting goods were marked down 75%,
and winter jackets were reduced by $30.
Crowds of shoppers bumped each other, grabbing 
for the best buys. After closing time, when
the sale was over, the owner gave each employee
a bottle of champagne for their hard work.
